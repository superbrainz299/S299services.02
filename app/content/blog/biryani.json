  "content": "Cookie Clicker is an incremental game created by French programmer Julien (Orteil) Thiennot in 2013. The user initially clicks on a big cookie on the screen, earning a single cookie per click. They can then spend their earned cookies upon purchasing assets such as cursors and other buildings that automatically produce cookies. Upgrades are also available and can improve the efficiency of clicks and buildings, among many other mechanics that allow the user to earn cookies in different ways. Though the game has no ending,[1] it has hundreds of achievements, and users may aim to reach milestone numbers of cookies.The game has a dedicated fanbase. Though the original version was coded in one night, Cookie Clicker is regularly updated. It has been widely described as addictive, and has been credited with playing a role in the emergence of idle gaming. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Clicker)",
